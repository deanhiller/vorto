shucks, normally would just buy it -> https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24584-3_108

LOL, would love to cheat and call the route optimization api though the assingment did not specifically say that was not allowed.... lol.   I am guessing you would not want that solution but work smart, not hard ;) ... joking.

Nearest Neighbor Algorithm vs. Two-Opt Algorithm - hmmmmm, thinking KISS get this done vs. better and I may lean towards KISS for now

I wonder, go KISS but run it massively parallel.  I will use threads but in real-world, I split to multiple servers.
